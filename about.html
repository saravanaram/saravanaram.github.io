         <p>I work out of my home office in Bangalore, India, but this blog, its content and opinions are my own. I blog about technology,
               gadgets, code, the web.                </p>
<p>I enjoy building things with a variety of programming languages, stacks and frameworks, teaching and mentoring.  </p>

<p>My interests include scalable distributed systems, infrastructure automation, devops, and more. </p>
